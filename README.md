# CassavaPy

A simple module to write, run and get outputs from DSSAT-Manihot model.

### Why CassavaPy?

Apart from get hands dirty with OOP, the aim of this module was to make my life easier during my master degree. 
I did not found nothing that answer my needs, so I decided to make it myself.

Since [my work](https://github.com/FabioSeixas/MasterResearch) is with irrigation and planting dates, the focus of CassavaPy is there.

### What CassavaPy can do?

1. **Create Experimental and Seasonal files changing:**

* Planting Dates
* Harvest Dates
* Irrigation
* Field (Soild and Weather Station) - **One by File**
* Simulation Start Date (.EXP files) - **One by File** - a parameter from Simulation Controls
* Genotype - **One by File**

2. **Create Batch Files**

* For Seasonal
* For Experimental
* More than one .EXP or .SNX for Batch File 

3. **Run Batch Files**

4. **Get Simulation Outputs**

### How CassavaPy should be improved in the future?

##### Make possible to change **Initial Conditions**
##### Make possible to put more than one **Field**, **Genotype** and **Simulation Controls** by file.
##### Improve the "Get Ouputs" part
