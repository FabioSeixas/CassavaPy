### Why CassavaPy?

Apart from get hands dirty with OOP, the aim of this module is to make my life easier during my master degree.
I did not found nothing that answer my needs, so I decided to make it myself.

Since my work is with irrigation and planting dates, the focus of CassavaPy is there.

### What CassavaPy can do?

1. **Create Experimental and Seasonal files and change the following:**

* Planting Dates
* Harvest Dates
* Irrigation
* Field (Soil and Weather Station) - **One by File**
* Simulation Start Date
* Genotype - **One by File**

2. **Create Batch Files**

* For Seasonal
* For Experimental

3. **Run Batch Files**

4. **Get Simulation Outputs**

### How CassavaPy should be improved in the future?

**1) I am working on a [Documentation](https://cassavapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)**

**2) Allows to put more than one *Genotype* by file**
